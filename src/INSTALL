- You need to set the environmental variable DIAMOND_ROOT
  that points to the top level of the tree (it should
  be the directory this file is in).

- Build the support files. Check support/readme for other dependencies.

  cd support; make

- Build Diamond.

  cd diamond; make


These two steps apply to the server:

- Index the data.

  Before you start the daemon, you need to run the program "odisk_idx"
  on the machine with the data.  You can find this in lib/libodisk.
  This will build the index files.

- Run adiskd.

  After this, the adiskd should work as normal.


This step applies to the client:

- Update gid_map and name_map to agree with the data on the server(s)
